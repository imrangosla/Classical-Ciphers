Your README file should include:

– Names and email addresses of all partners.
– The programming language you use (e.g. C++, Java, Python)
– How to execute your program.
– Whether you implemented the extra credit.
– Anything special about your submission that we should take note of.

Programming Language: C++

How to execute our program:

	make
	
	./cipher <CIPHER NAME> <KEY> <ENC/DEC> <INPUTFILE> <OUTPUT FILE>
	
	  where:
		<CIPHER NAME> = {PLF, RTS, RFC, VIG, CES, HIL} //name of the cipher
		<KEY> = {
			PLF: string of length 25 or less with non repeating characters //note: playfair alphabet converts j -> i
			RTS: an integer string representing rows to be transposed //squence of integers from 1 to key.length() must be present
			RFC: integer that represnets the number of rails
			VIG: a string
			CES: integer representing alphanumeric shift
			HIL: integer representing key matrix //input n will result in user inputing an nxn matrix at runtime
		} //encryption key to use
		<ENC/DEC> = {ENC, DEC} //whether to encrypt or decrypt, respectively
		<INPUTFILE> = the file from which to read the input
		<OUTPUT> = the file to which the output shall be written
		
	  examples:
	
		Playfair
		./cipher PLF security ENC in.txt out.txt
		
		Row Transposition
		./cipher RTS 35142 DEC in.txt out.txt
		
		Railfence
		./cipher RFC 4 ENC in.txt out.txt
		
		Vigenre
		./cipher VIG lemon ENC in.txt out.txt
		
		Caesar
		./cipher CES 11 DEC in.txt out.txt
		
		Hill
		./cipher Hil 3 ENC in.txt out.txt
		....
		Input Key Matrix (3x3): 2 17 5 3 8 2 11 23 4
		
Extra Credit:

	Hill Cipher Encryption Implemented (decryption not attempted)
